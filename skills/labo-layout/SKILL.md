# Create and use a research workspace

For each user request, follow the [required consultation](../research-router/references/consultation.md).

When author identity, voice, or preferences matter, consult the Labo workspace
[author profile](../../../profile/author-identity.md) when available. Keep
personal facts there rather than in skill text; update only explicit durable
facts or corrections from the user, or facts they ask to save, with source
context. Apply this skill's normal verification rules.

Use for requests such as 「研究室を初期化して」「inboxのこれで研究したい」
or 「この資料・原稿はどこに置く？」. Read the [directory contract](references/layout.md).
For creation commands and their effects, read [workspace creation](references/creation.md).

Resolve the workspace from the loaded policy submodule's Git superproject,
or use the user's explicit destination. Resolve `scripts/labo.py` from this
skill's real directory (`../../scripts/labo.py`), not from the shell's cwd.
Inspect the relevant existing paths before writing; the directory need not
be named `labo`. A placement question alone needs an answer, not scaffolding.

## Initialize

When asked to set up the workspace, run `layout init`. It adds missing core
directories, creates an empty `AGENTS.md` only if absent, and appends missing
build-ignore patterns. Existing files and personal instructions stay intact.
The normal setup is **fork `labo-skills`, then mount the user's fork at
`.agents` as a submodule**. Installation steps are in the creation reference.
If already connected, use that checkout; it is where the user develops their
own improvements and optional upstream contributions.

## Start or resume research

For an inbox-based research request:

1. Read the selected sources, preserving their original bytes. Inventory
   existing programs with `research list --format json` when `research/`
   exists, then read the relevant plans. Relate new input to the existing
   question before deciding whether a new program is needed.
2. Use `research-management` for the research story and evidence. A request
   to start research authorizes creating the necessary program; do not ask
   for a skill name or repeat permission. Ask only if an unresolved choice
   would substantially change the research direction. Propose splits or
   mergers of existing programs before changing their boundaries.
3. For a new program, use `layout new research` with a meaningful title and
   summary grounded in the material. Fill the generated `plan.md` body with
   the question, context, current evidence, open issues, and first concrete
   investigation. A template alone does not complete an intake request.
4. Store assigned originals in `research/<slug>/inbox/`; check for name
   collisions and preserve bytes when moving or copying. Record their origin
   in the plan. If one source serves several programs, keep one original and
   link to it. Keep imported AI proposals distinguishable from verified results.
5. Run `research check`, then continue the requested investigation from the
   recorded next step. For an existing program, update its current story;
   do not create a new program merely because another file arrived.

## Place other work

Use `layout new paper` or `layout new reference` when a new item is needed.
Create reading notes under `reading/`, formalizations under `lean/`, and
optional website/profile material only when those tasks arise. The directory
contract explains their relationships; output slugs need not match programs.
Layout creation supplies paths and templates, not mathematical validation or
permission to publish. Read the owning skill when doing the substantive work.

Keep operational rules in the policy checkout. Leave the user's `AGENTS.md`
content and existing research intact. Do not copy policy READMEs into private
data, bulk-migrate old `doc` papers, or change Git privacy settings as setup.
