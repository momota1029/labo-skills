# Research routing

Before the first delegation, including consultation, retrieve the models and
reasoning settings actually callable through the host's delegation interface,
using its discovery tools/API or runtime catalogue. A provider-wide catalogue
alone does not establish availability. If readily exposed, obtain your own
model and effort from matching current-session metadata; otherwise mark them
unknown, rather than inferring them from defaults or self-description.

Choose each needed role's model and effort from that set using task requirements
and available model-selection skills or current official guidance. Do not fix
advisor, prover, or reviewer roles to model families by convention. Honor explicit
user model constraints; otherwise prefer current suitable models and justify older
choices. Reuse discovery within the task and pass selections through actual tool
arguments.
Apply the same criteria to roles you keep; delegate content-understanding or
research-reasoning work if your own model's suitability cannot be established.

For each user request, follow the [required consultation](references/consultation.md).

1. Identify the **artifact and reader**: research story, Lean, manuscript,
   slide, reading note, reference, website, or repo policy.
2. Consult the matching skill, read it completely, and follow **its own**
   references. Do not accumulate all skills' rules by default.
3. Workspace setup, paths, and inbox intake → `labo-layout`;
   research lifecycle and story → `research-management`;
   mathematical paper review → `paper-referee`; paper compilation →
   `labo-build`; slides → `slide-authoring`; source collection, paper/book
   explanation and reading notes → `reading-reference`; website →
   `website-publishing`; skill improvements in the user's fork →
   `labo-self-improve`; selected upstream contributions → `labo-pr`.
4. Beyond the required consultation, if task-specific delegation is useful,
   formulate a short task-specific assignment *from the selected skill*.
   Do not depend on a proprietary stored subagent persona or prompt template.
   Independent result reviews start in a fresh context with the original request,
   constraints, artifact, and necessary primary sources. Do not inherit the
   implementation conversation or the author's or coordinator's verdict.
   Choose by the mathematical judgment needed to establish correctness:

   - **Routine processing** (organization, extraction, prescribed conversion):
     lightweight model, low reasoning effort.
   - **Content understanding** (literature synthesis, explaining known arguments):
     general-purpose model, standard or higher reasoning effort.
   - **Research reasoning** (proofs, assumptions, counterexamples, mathematical
     review): current upper-tier model suited to mathematical reasoning, high effort.

   Reconstructing missing arguments counts as research reasoning, even in a
   summary.
5. Keep the user's `AGENTS.md` independent. Do not edit it as part of routing.

The research plan supplies human context; a skill supplies the operational
rules. Neither is an excuse to expose private material in public changes.
