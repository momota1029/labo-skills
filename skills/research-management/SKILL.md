# Research program maintenance

For each user request, follow the [required consultation](../research-router/references/consultation.md).

When author identity, voice, or preferences matter, consult the Labo workspace
[author profile](../../../profile/author-identity.md) when available. Keep
personal facts there rather than in skill text; update only explicit durable
facts or corrections from the user, or facts they ask to save, with source
context. Apply this skill's normal verification rules.

Read [research policy](references/research-policy.md) before changing a plan.
Start with the central question and the developing argument, not publication
milestones. Inspect `plan.md` and only the smallest related evidence needed.

Keep the research story, prior-literature evidence, and relevant Lean work in
conversation. Use sources to locate the question and its relation to earlier
results; use formalization to pressure-test definitions, assumptions, and
candidate claims. Let either kind of evidence reshape the plan, and record
which claims are formalized, proved by other means, or still open.

For substantive plan drafts, full plan revisions, or requests to explain a
whole research program, apply the claim-level evidence and prior-work standard
in [research policy](references/research-policy.md).
Distinguish what prior sources establish, what this program adds, and what
remains conjectural or open. Compare the relevant hypotheses, objects,
conclusions, and proof methods; link each central claim to its exact source and
proof record. The plan should explain the decisive proof mechanism and its
dependencies, while each established central result has a complete, inspected
derivation in the linked record. Open claims need a concrete proof route,
missing lemmas, and known obstacles. Never infer novelty from an absent
citation or an unsuccessful search.

Use `labo-layout` for workspace and program creation. A request to start
research from supplied material authorizes creating the necessary plan and
source directory; reuse a relevant existing program when appropriate.
Populate the story and next investigation from that material, distinguishing
proposals from established evidence. Do not stop at an empty template.

When useful, proactively **propose** a new program, split, combination,
reframing, or temporary cessation of work. Changes beyond the requested work,
especially existing program boundaries, are editorial recommendations for human
review, not state-machine transitions or automatic deletion.
Apply accepted changes with Git history, preserve all original sources, and
run `python3 <labo-script> research check`.

Resolve `<labo-script>` to the absolute `../../scripts/labo.py` path relative
to this skill's **real directory** (follow symlinks first), not the shell's
current directory. This executes the policy checkout being used, without
installing the project. The launcher detects the private Git superproject;
use `--workspace /absolute/path/to/labo` to override it or when using a
standalone policy checkout. For a frontmatter-only inventory, run
`python3 <labo-script> research list --format json`.
