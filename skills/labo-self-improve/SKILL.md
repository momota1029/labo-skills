# Research institute self-improvement

Luna and Haiku only collect evidence here and hand substantive work to another agent: [roles](../research-router/references/editing-capability.md).

When author identity, voice, or preferences matter, consult the Labo workspace
[author profile](../../../profile/author-identity.md) when available. Keep
personal facts there rather than in skill text; update only explicit durable
facts or corrections from the user, or facts they ask to save, with source
context. Apply this skill's normal verification and publication rules.

The user normally runs their own fork as the `.agents` submodule. Develop
improvements there so mathematical practice can feed back into shared skills.
Fork-specific choices can remain in the fork; upstream acceptance is not a
prerequisite for using them. A maintainer working directly in the shared
repository has no fork-only category: see the
[publication boundary](../labo-git/SKILL.md#publication-boundary).
Use [labo-git](../labo-git/SKILL.md) when repository boundaries or push checks
need setup. Follow its [publication boundary](../labo-git/SKILL.md#publication-boundary):
both push and PR operate in the independent policy Git. The parent research
repository is pushed to the user's own private remote as usual; its history is not a
dependency of either operation.

For all skill creation and changes in this collection, apply
[reviewable skill design](references/skill-design.md): group reusable work by
responsibility, keep existing-skill edits focused on necessary integration, and
make a future PR understandable on its own. Use skill-creator for authoring
mechanics when available; this reference owns the collection's design conventions.

Keep the complete reusable harness in that checkout: instructions, formats,
templates, executable code, and synthetic tests. `.agents` and `.claude` are
possible placements, not separate implementations. The host workspace follows
the checked-out policy. Do not make private host code, copied rules, or a
separately installed executable the real authority while the skill merely
describes it. Private mathematical material remains in the parent workspace.

Treat friction in workflows as actionable research infrastructure feedback.
When a recurring problem appears:

1. Describe the failure and the smallest generalizable change.
2. Distinguish a reusable upstream improvement, a fork-specific preference,
   and private research material. Edit the first two in the fork checkout;
   private-only material stays outside that public Git history. Before adding
   motivating evidence to the skill checkout, apply the
   [public extraction boundary](../labo-pr/references/publication-gate.md): carry
   over reusable rules/procedures and self-contained fictional examples, not the
   research sources, reading accounts or unpublished mathematics. A skill's
   `references/` directory is for generic guidance, not an exception for private
   research material. Keep the actual incident and trial evidence in the private
   parent workspace. Public access to a source does not authorize bundling it.
3. Identify the owner under [reviewable skill design](references/skill-design.md).
   Refine the existing owner or introduce a distinct reusable skill as appropriate;
   keep detailed rules with that owner and connect callers through short links.
4. Implement and check the authorized change using that checkout's tools.
   Use synthetic examples to make a reusable change reviewable independently
   of the research that motivated it. For instruction changes, preserve the
   useful decision criterion without accumulating incident-specific prose.
   For runtime or path changes, test the actual mounted launcher under both
   `.agents` and `.claude`, including invocation outside the workspace. Preserve
   host discovery choices and user-owned `AGENTS.md`; do not add policy copies.
5. When useful, present the concrete reusable change as an upstream PR
   candidate. The user can keep it fork-only or contribute it through `labo-pr`;
   an existing request to contribute already settles that choice. A public
   fork is public even without a PR; private-only material stays outside it.
6. Commit the selected policy changes, push the fork, or publish a PR only
   within the requested scope. In a fork whose owner enabled it, finished branches are
   merged or deleted without asking, and `main` is brought level with upstream, under
   [fork housekeeping](references/fork-housekeeping.md). A push alone does not request a PR; a requested
   PR includes its necessary reviewed branch push. Parent gitlink recording
   is separate local work, never a prerequisite for policy publication. To adopt
   upstream improvements, inspect and integrate them into the user's fork,
   validate there, then advance the parent pin; preserve local customizations.

An agent may propose reorganization of skills and research programs, but
must not equate optimization with deletion of old mathematical work.
