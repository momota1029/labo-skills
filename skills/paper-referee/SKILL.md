# Mathematical paper referee

For each user request, follow the [required consultation](../research-router/references/consultation.md).

When author identity, voice, or preferences matter, consult the Labo workspace
[author profile](../../../profile/author-identity.md) when available. Keep
personal facts there rather than in skill text; update only explicit durable
facts or corrections from the user, or facts they ask to save, with source
context. Apply this skill's normal verification rules. For author-blind
reading, defer profile access until the blind review record is complete.

Read [numbered standards](references/standards.md). For English prose or
typesetting review, also read [English conventions](references/english-style.md).
Infer the paper, audience and requested scope from the task. Default to a
mathematician outside the immediate specialty. A section-only request stays
local; a whole-paper request must account for the whole paper, even when read
in parts. Reviewing does not authorize rewriting, building, or publishing.

Resolve `<labo-script>` below to the absolute `../../scripts/labo.py` path
relative to this skill's **real directory** (follow symlinks first). Do not
use a globally installed `labo` command or infer the workspace from the
shell's current directory. The launcher uses its private Git superproject;
pass `--workspace /absolute/path/to/labo` to override it or when using a
standalone policy checkout.

## Review protocol

1. Fix the source version and scope. If the abstract is in scope, read it
   alone first and record what question, result and significance are recoverable.
   Keep research plans, author explanations and earlier reviews out of the
   initial reader assessment; they can inform subsequent evidence checks.
2. For a paper-wide or openings-only review, run
   `python3 <labo-script> paper map --paper <slug> --format json`.
   It follows literal `main.tex` inclusions and reads only section openings
   up to `% LABO:INTRO-END`. Record the argument and dependency route those
   openings actually convey, including what remains unclear. Unsupported
   TeX inclusion needs explicit resolution, not a guessed manuscript order.
3. Read each assigned section with
   `python3 <labo-script> paper section --paper <slug> --name <NN-slug>`.
   Reconstruct its claim from the visible text before following signposted
   dependencies. Record the first missing object, relation or inference and
   any later recovery separately. A precise usable reference can suffice;
   an expert's ability to invent a missing bridge cannot.
4. Check disputed mathematics and attribution against the relevant proof,
   Lean declaration or exact source passage. Distinguish a demonstrated
   defect, a concern, and unavailable evidence. For verbosity, identify what
   a deletion, replacement or relocation preserves; do not recommend cuts
   from word count alone. Retain clear, economical passages.
5. Return findings with **rule ID, severity, passage/line, evidence, and
   smallest sufficient repair**. State the version, sections and dependencies
   actually read, remaining scope, and a concise example that worked. A clean
   local reading is not a correctness or whole-paper certificate.

## Optional independent reading

If a fresh reader is requested or needed to test an accessibility concern,
use an available isolated agent with only the frozen artifact and neutral
reader brief. It reports understanding and first confusion before proposing
repairs; do not supply the intended story, prior findings, or author answers.
Compose the assignment for the task; no saved role or model is required.
Without fresh isolation, label the result a local reading, not a blind review.
`paper map` and `paper section` load complete openings/sections: they do not
establish paragraph-by-paragraph prefix isolation. Check a rendered artifact
when making visual claims. Subsequent repairs and rechecks follow the user's
scope; a report-only review does not start an automatic revision loop.
